        <h2>Milk Toast Taco Ideas:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Vehicle Damage:</strong> Every vehicle part has a value from 1-10. High damage can cause leaks or malfunctions!</li>
            <li><strong>Vehicle Buying/Selling/Reselling:</strong> Buy vehicles at dealerships or online. Prices are calculated based on installed parts and slightly randomized. Selling works similarly, with NPC offers depending on price.</li>
            <li><strong>Vehicle Parts System:</strong> Install aftermarket parts via mechanics or DIY garages. Multiplayer shops adjust prices dynamically based on demand. Watch out for scams and legality issues!</li>
            <li><strong>Police System:</strong> Police patrol areas, issue fines, pursue suspects, and adapt tactics. Laws vary by state, and false trials are possible!</li>
            <li><strong>Economy & Trade System:</strong> Prices depend on supply, demand, and NPC decisions. Small changes can ripple across towns and states!</li>
            <li><strong>NPC System:</strong> NPCs have traits and personalities affecting jobs, interactions, witnessing events, rumors, and union activity.</li>
            <li><strong>Construction & Terrain:</strong> Dig, build, and modify terrain anywhere. Cut and fill for foundations, move materials, and manage construction projects.</li>
            <li><strong>Property & Real Estate System:</strong> Buy property from agents or online. NPCs start with land to simulate a living economy.</li>
            <li><strong>Insurance System:</strong> Vehicle insurance covers crashes, theft, and more. Premiums vary by behavior, vehicle, and area. Fraud and scams exist!</li>
            <li><strong>Fuel & Energy System:</strong> Fuel consumption depends on terrain, vehicle, and driving style. Stations vary in price and availability. DIY fuel depots possible.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Ideas Im Working On:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Vehicle History Reports: Track owners, accidents, modifications. Some may be forged.</li>
            <li>NPC Gossip System: Reputation spreads organically.</li>
            <li>NPC Unions: Workers strike if conditions are bad.</li>
            <li>Dynamic News System: Newspapers and radio report on events, markets, and player crimes.</li>
            <li>Dynamic Pursuits: Police roadblocks, spike strips, helicopters, traffic tactics.</li>
            <li>Vehicle History Forgery: Legal consequences if discovered.</li>
            <li>Weather Impact: Roads, mud, and terrain affect vehicles, police, and NPC behavior.</li>
        </ul>
